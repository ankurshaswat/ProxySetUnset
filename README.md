# ProxySetUnset

Any suggestions are welcome. Do contact me if you want any extra proxy settings to be implemented in this script.

This script sets and unsets proxy settings in network setting and also for the terminal and some other basic apps in linux.

When running for first time change the permissions for script by running the following commands in terminal while in the repo folder:-
1."chmod 777 set_proxy.sh"
2."chmod 777 unset_proxy.sh"


Just run in terminal ./set_proxy.sh to set proxy
and ./unset_proxy.sh to unset it.
